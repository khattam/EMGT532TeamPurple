## Image Generation Tips:

1. **Generate in batches** - Start with Hero section first (most important)
2. **Iterate** - If colors don't match, ask DALL-E to "make the background darker" or "increase blue accent lighting"
3. **Consistency** - Use similar phrases across prompts for consistent style
4. **Aspect Ratios** - DALL-E 3 supports:
   - Square: 1024x1024
   - Landscape: 1792x1024
   - Portrait: 1024x1792

## After Generation:

1. Save images to: `drowsiness-wearable-landing/public/images/`
2. Name them clearly:
   - `hero-product.png`
   - `feature-heart-rate.png`
   - `app-dashboard.png`
   - etc.

3. I'll help you integrate them into the components once you have them!

## Color Reference (for consistency):
- Primary Blue: #0066FF
- Cyan Accent: #00D9FF
- Background: #0a0a0a (very dark, almost black)
- Use these hex codes if DALL-E asks for specific colors
